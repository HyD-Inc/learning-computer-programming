Types of programming language
=============================

There are many types of programming languages but for the moment we are
concerned about the following two:

- Compiled language
- Interpreted language

Compiled language
-----------------

Has compiler(s), there maybe many compilers provided by different vandors.

The example languages are kotlin, Java. Android studio has full functionalities related
to building/compiling kotlin programs. As said above, there maybe other
compilers from different vardors.

A compiler usually turns the compiled program into binary packages.
